How to contribute to Android4Lumia
==========

First off, to anyone who plans on contributing code to the project, thank you!

## â€¢ Starting off

* Code must be tested by you before submitting a pull request to accept it.
We will still review it, but we are not a code cleanup team. Be confident in what you submit!
* You can create pull requests with multiple changes packed together, but unrelated changes must be in their
separate commits. This way it's possible to pick some of the changes and add them without adding every change
in the pull request and still keep your name show up with the commits introducing the changes.
* If a pull request has unrelated changes in a single commit, you will be asked to split it up into multiple
commits. If that does not happen, and some of the changes are considered useful for the project, we will
re-commit those changes ourselves as they were our changes, but will still add your name to the commit
description as original author.
* Pull requests must detail every change included in one. We want to know what you are changing.
Failure to do so will guarentee that your pull request will be rejected or viewed last.
* Use common sense! If you dont think that you are submitting is ready, then don't believe that we are ready
to accept your changes.

Beyond pull requests

If you become a regular contributer and provide quality work, you may be given the chance to push directly to
repos if your work is consistent.

We encourage helping each other!
