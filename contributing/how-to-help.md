How to contribute to Android4Lumia
==========

First off, to anyone who plans on contributing code to the project, thank you!

â€¢ Starting off
==========
* Code must be tested by you before submitting a pull request to accept it.
We will still review it, but we are not a code cleanup team. Be confident in what you submit!
* Pull requests must detail every change included in one. We want to know what you are changing.
Failure to do so will guarentee that your pull request will be rejected or viewed last.
* Use common sense! If you dont think that you are submitting is ready, then don't believe that we are ready
to accept your changes.

Beyond pull requests
==========

If you become a regular contributer and provide quality work, you may be given the chance to push directly to
repos if your work is consistent.

We encourage helping each other!
